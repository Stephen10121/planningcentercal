# TailorCal
[![Docker Build For Planning CenterCal Frontend](https://github.com/Stephen10121/planningcentercal/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Stephen10121/planningcentercal/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is the website repo for my TailorCal project. This website lets you login with your Planning Center account. The website will fetch your events and create an events calendar for you. You can create multiple custom calendars and each calendar instance can sort by approval status, time, organizer, etc.

## TODO

Approval: show all except for rejected.
